# Pattern Printing in C++

This program demonstrates 9 fundamental pattern printing techniques commonly used in DSA practice and programming interviews.

## 📋 Patterns Implemented

1. **Square Pattern** - Basic 4×4 grid of stars
2. **Right Angle Triangle** - Growing triangle with stars
3. **Right Angle Triangle (Numbers)** - Triangle with incrementing numbers per row
4. **Right Angle Triangle (Same Number)** - Triangle where each row repeats its row number
5. **Inverted Right Angle Triangle** - Decreasing triangle with stars
6. **Inverted Right Angle Triangle (Numbers)** - Inverted triangle with numbers
7. **Star Pyramid** - Centered pyramid pattern
8. **Inverted Star Pyramid** - Upside-down pyramid
9. **Diamond Star Pattern** - Full diamond shape combining pyramid patterns

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- **Nested Loops**: Understanding row and column iteration
- **Loop Control**: Forward and reverse iteration patterns
- **Spacing Logic**: Creating centered patterns with proper alignment
- **Mathematical Relationships**: Calculating stars based on row numbers (e.g., `i * 2 - 1`)

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
g++ index.cpp -o pattern
./pattern
```

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Master nested loop structures
- Understand pattern logic and mathematical formulas
- Build foundation for matrix and 2D array problems
- Develop spatial reasoning for output formatting
